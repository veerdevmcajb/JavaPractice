Stream -> The contineous flow. read and write.

Buffer Stream--> Buffer is a mermory.
Buffer Streams are exactly same as Byte Stream and Character Streams with more efficiency.

syntax:
1) BufferedInputStream bis=new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("path"));

2)        BufferedOutputStream bos=new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""));

3)      BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new FileReader(""));
4)        BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(""));



in DataSTream which order you are writing the data in that order only you have to retrived the data. (100 % order followed.)

we can write that object into a file and i can send it to you.
it is a process of converting class obj into network supported format or file supported format.
