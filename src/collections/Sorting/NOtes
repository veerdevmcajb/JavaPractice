// we are sorting the object data. by using Comparable Interface.
/*  If we want to apply sorting on user define object like student ,Employee,product etc...
    then we have two approach
    1) Comparable (java.lang)
    2) Comparator (java.util)

    -> Comparable is a predefine interface available in java.lang pack.
    -> Comparable interface having CompareTo(Object obj)method
    -> compareTo()method is used to compare an object with itself and return int value.
    -> comparable interface will allow us to sort the data based on only one value.

    - To overcome this problem we will go for Comparator Interface.
    - Comparator is a predefine interface available in java.util package.
    - Comparator interface having compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
