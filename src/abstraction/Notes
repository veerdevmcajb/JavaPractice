Abstract
- Abstract class contains abstract methods. and may not contains abstract methods.
- for abstract classes  object creation is not allowed.
- one abstract class contains multiple implementation classes.
- The abstract class can hold implementation class object.
- abstract methods cannot be -> private, static, final

* ex2-
    If the abstrct class contains abstract methods write the implementation
    in child classes.
    if the child class is unable to provide implementation of all abstract methods
    then declare the child class with abstract modifier , and complete the remaining
    method implementations in next created child classes.
    - it is possible to declare multiple child classes but at final we have to complete the implementation
    of all abstract methods.

    * We can create a constructor in abstract class. but we have to use inheritance.

    *  inside the abstract class it is possible to declare the vaiables,methods,blocks.

    * inside the abstract class it is possible to declare main method.

    * abstract methods means we have to override that methods in child classes but
        final,static,private methods are not possible to override so that combination in illegal.

    * we can overload abstract methods : Yes
        ex. abstract class Test{
            abstract void add(int a,int b);
            abstract void add(int a,int b, int c);
            abstract void add(int a,int b, int c,int d);
        }

    * we can override abstract methods : Yes.
