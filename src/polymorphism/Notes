- Polymorphism
    - one function with different behaviours is called polymorphism.
    - the ability of msg will be display in more than one format.

    * There are two types of polymorphism is java.
        1) compile Time polymorphism.
            - method overloading.
        2) Run time polymorphism.
            - methos overriding.

        - compile Time polymorphism :- The bind between method calling stmts and the implimaintation of
                                        overloaded methods occures during in the compilation is known as compile time poly.

        - Methid overloading
         - Method Overloading - Same method name with different formal arguments.
         - we can create a no of methods in a class.
         - method overloading is a example of compile time polymorphism.
         - Method overloading just check the method signature and overload method have a diffe return type.

        - Run time polymorphism :- The bind between method calling stmts and implimentation of overloaded
                                    overloaded methods occures during in the runtimr is known as Runtime polymorphism.
